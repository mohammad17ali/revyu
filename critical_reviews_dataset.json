The manager appeared untrained and unprofessional, which unfortunately reflects in the behavior of the rest of the staff. This has been the worst retail experience I've had to date. The excuses given for a simple return were both shocking and unacceptable.\nIn the morning, the staff was busy gossiping instead of assisting with the return, asking the customer to come back later in the afternoon. On returning, I was told again that it wasn’t 2 PM yet—despite arriving just five minutes early. This level of disregard for a customer’s time is appalling.\nYour return policy is also unnecessarily rigid and poorly communicated. I will definitely be escalating this matter further",

Despite my explanation, they continued insisting and even suggested that I provide a relative's or friend's membership number if I didn’t have one of my own.\n\nThis behavior made me feel extremely uncomfortable and pressured. I believe no customer should be forced or coerced in this way, especially after clearly communicating their situation.",

Due to a misunderstanding, I accepted my small mistake, but the way one of the staff members reacted was extremely unprofessional.\n\nThe lady in question began blaming me using harsh words, raised her voice, and behaved very rudely. Even after checking everything thoroughly and finding nothing wrong, she continued to speak in an unacceptable manner.\n\nThis was the worst experience I’ve ever had in any retail store. Such behavior is not expected, especially from customer service staff. I strongly believe that all female staff, and in fact the entire team, should be trained on how to speak respectfully and professionally with customers.\n\nVery disappointed with Westside today",

When we went to the billing counter, we were told we couldn’t purchase it unless we registered by paying ₹200 — only then would we get a ₹400 voucher. The other option? Shop for more items.\n\nIt seems there’s an unspoken rule here that customers must shop above a certain amount to make a purchase. This is outrageous. Why can’t a customer simply buy what they want, pay, and leave? Forcing additional purchases or a paid registration just to buy a single item is unacceptable.",
