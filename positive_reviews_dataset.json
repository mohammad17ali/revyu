    "original_review": "Select Citywalk Mall is one of the best malls in Delhi — modern, clean, and full of life. The vibe is upscale but still welcoming. You'll find a great mix of premium and mid-range brands, so whether you're window shopping or ready to spend, there's something for everyone.\n\nThe food court has a solid variety — from Indian street-style to international chains. There are also plenty of cute cafes and dessert spots if you're in the mood to chill. Ambience is classy, and they often have seasonal decor or live events that add to the experience.\n\nOnly downside is that it can get really crowded on weekends, and prices are definitely on the higher side — so not the most budget-friendly place. But overall, it's perfect for a day out with friends, a casual date, or even solo exploration",

    "original_review": "Select City Walk in Saket is one of my favorite places to take my kids whenever they feel bored and want a fun outing during our visits to India. It’s the perfect spot for a mix of entertainment and relaxation — whether it’s catching a movie, grabbing a quick snack, or just enjoying some family time. My kids especially love exploring the mall and checking out the different activities, which keeps them happily engaged for hours.\n\nFor snacks or a quick bite, Khan Chacha and the coffee shop on the first level, tucked in the corner next to the central circle, are our go-to spots. The food is always fresh and delicious, and it’s a nice place to sit, relax, and enjoy a treat. If you’re looking for something more substantial, the Dhaba on the upper level (I believe that’s the name) is a great choice for authentic Indian food — especially after a few cold drinks. The atmosphere there feels lively and welcoming, making it a perfect spot to enjoy traditional flavors in a casual setting.\n\nOverall, Select City Walk is more than just a mall — it’s a family-friendly destination that combines shopping, food, and entertainment seamlessly. Every time we visit, it becomes a memorable outing for the kids and a convenient place for adults to unwind. Highly recommended for anyone visiting Delhi with family or looking for a fun place to hang out.",
